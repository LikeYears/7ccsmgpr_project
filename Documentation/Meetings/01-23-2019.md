# Aims

There are two main issues to discuss at our first meeting before coding.
 - What the project is
 - How to implement it

# Attendance

  - Everyone

# Reference
This is the main requirements for the project, to develop a multi-host file synchroniser.

>File synchronisation tools (e.g. Dropbox, Unison) help make it
possible to edit the same files across multiple computers in a
sensible way.<br>
You need to implement a ‘hub and spoke‘ file synchroniser: a
single central server (the ‘hub’) to which multiple other clients
(the ‘spokes’) synchronise.<br>
You must develop a server application and two clients: one for
desktop, one for mobile.



# Outcome

There are still some questions we cannot make agreements:

 - How should we synchronize files like picture or movie? In other way, should we develop a same method to synchronize for all files?
 - As for synchronization, our idea for it is to download and upload file, is this way works for our goal or we should deal with it just like Google Docs?
